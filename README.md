The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of sepsis onset in ICU patients based on a wide range of physiological parameters collected over time. Early prediction of sepsis could drastically reduce mortality rates by enabling clinicians to administer timely interventions. The aim includes:
•	Develop a predictive model using an LSTM-based deep learning network to handle time-series ICU data.
•	Use key patient vitals and lab test results as input features.
•	Train the model on publicly available sepsis datasets.
•	Deploy the model with an interactive input interface for live testing.
